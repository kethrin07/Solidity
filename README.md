# Project Title

Create a Token

## Description

In making MyToken, I wanted to create a simple yet powerful tool for digital money. Imagine it like building blocks for a digital world. You can see important details like the token's name ("META") and abbreviation ("MTA") upfront. With a special system, we keep track of who has how much of the token. When we "mint" tokens, it's like making new ones out of thin air, giving them to certain people. But we also have a "burn" feature, which lets us take tokens out of circulation carefully. It's like having a way to control how many tokens are out there, making sure everything stays fair and secure.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code into the file.

Click on the "Compile" tab on the left sidebar to compile your Solidity code. Ensure there are no compilation errors.

Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select the correct compiler version and choose the environment. Click "Deploy" to deploy your contract.

Once deployed, you'll see your contract in the "Deployed Contracts" section. Expand it to see its functions and variables. Use the provided UI to interact with your contract, such as minting or burning tokens.
